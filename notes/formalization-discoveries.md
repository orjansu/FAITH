--Case study 1
I thought that the last step in case study 1 was -@-rules-1, but since the tool checked and saw that the side conditions didn't hold, I realized it was -@-rules-2.
I realized that I had the wrong context, and the discovery was when I checked where the callstack called. Add a log there perhaps?
